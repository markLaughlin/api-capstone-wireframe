This is a very rough wireframe of the project; as you can see, there's no stying yet. 

The basic working idea, however, is present. The user gets a screen requesting a candidate name, enters the name and gets information back. 

I'm still developing "bad case" scenarios where the candidate's name entered by the user doesn't exist in the database.
